- This course will share examples of the real-world problems encountered when building Recommender Systems.
- Recommender Systems are one of the most valuable applications in ML and AI today.
- In the past, Amazon has attributed over 20% of their revenue to recommendations.
- Companies like YouTube and Netflix rely almost entirely on their recommendation systems to help their users discover new content.

- At the end of this course, you’ll have experience of a wide variety of techniques for applying recommender systems to real-world data.
- We’ll start off with an overview of how Recommender Systems are used, and then we’ll create our own framework for testing different algorithms on real-world movie data.
- We’ll develop examples of Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering, Model-based Methods and Deep Learning with Artificial Neural Networks. 
- We’ll learn how to generate recommendations at massive scale on the cloud using TensorFlow, Amazon DSSTNE, Amazon SageMaker and Apache Spark.
- We’ll also look at in-depth case studies from YouTube and Netflix.

- We’ll first install a Python development environment on our PC, then install a package for Python called Surprise that makes developing Recommender Systems easy. Finally we’ll download some course materials, including some real movie data, and make movie recommendations for a real person.
- We can head over to [Sundog Educations’ RecSys Page](https://www.sundog-education.com/recsys/) for setup instructions. First, we’ll need Anaconda, which we can get from [Anaconda’s Download Page](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
